## Background

I'm not learning python for the first time, but I do require a refresher. I was originally taught Python around 2015. That's 9 years ago.

On top of that, my use-cases continue to be either unsuitable for python, otherwise too complicated for me to be able to implement without understanding some further background about said use-cases' stack/s.

Well, I need to expand a little bit. We worked with numpy and had to work out some algorithms in python, but I mostly have only been running others' code... not writing my own.
