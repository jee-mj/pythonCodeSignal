This be the moment I realise that my strength is not in statistics.

I have been trying to get better at coding python for a job application that required taking an exam in 12 days, but the content has started becoming more difficult to process.

I should play to my strengths, and leave this alone for now. I'm a good artist after all.

Plus, python always has been and always will be... UGLY. if_i_get_a_job, itWillProbablyAllBeInSnakeCaseWithUglython. ðŸ«£

Context:

What actually happened was that I thought accessing a dataset and loading it into a dataFrame was enough revision and neglected to actually transfer my OOP skills from C#/JS to Python before taking the exam.

I failed the exam as deserved.
